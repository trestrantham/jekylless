Jekylless
=========

Jekylless is a fork of [jekyll][jekyll], a blog aware, static site generator. We are planning to stay as close as possible to the original jekyll project, but we have a added a few improvements with which we cannot live without:

* Integration of LESS
* Growl Notifications
* Liquid permalink tag
* Time tag in blog posts

If you want to know more about the motivations behind the creation of this fork, check out Tate Johnson's [blog post][motivation] about creating this fork. Jekylless was previously known as tatey-jekyll.

*********************

### Integration of LESS

[LESS][lesscss] is an extension to CSS which adds variables, nesting and mixins. Unlike Sass, LESS strives for familiarity and backwards compatibility with CSS.

To get the LESS integration to work, you'll need to install the [less gem][lessgem].

After that you only need to change your css files extension to .less and add two lines of triple dashes (`---`) to the top of your less files, to tell jekyll, that this file is not a static file anymore and that it has to be compiled from now on.



*********************

### Growl 

![Growl integration](http://tatey.com/images/posts/2009-12-05-forking-jekyll-now-with-less-and-growl-notifications/growl.jpg)

Stop killing your browserâ€™s reload button and let Jekyll notify you when the build is complete. To get it to work, you will need to have OS X and to install [growlnotify][growlnotify] (a command line tool available in Growl Extras) and the [Growl gem][growlgem] which provides Ruby bindings to growlnotify.


*********************

### Liquid permalink tag

Link to a published post by its name and the permalink tag will be compiled into an anchor. The permalink tag will respect your post's permalink structure.

<pre>
<code>{&#37; permalink 'Earlier post', '2009-09-09-foo' &#37;}</code>
</pre>

...is compiled to

    <a href="/2009/09/09/foo/">Earlier post</a>


*********************

### Time tag in blog posts

In the original jekyll, the time of the blog posts is set to 00:00:00 of the beginning day. Of course this is not always the time, when you are publishing blog posts. Even if you are not planning to show the concrete date on your website, your feed readers will thank you, for being a little more precise. Therefore we have added a time tag. If you want to specify a time in your blog post, add a tag like this to your blog post:
 
    time: '21:34'

*********************

### Installation

Jekylless executable conflicts with Jekyll. You'll need to uninstall Jekyll before installing Jekylless.

    $ gem uninstall jekyll
    $ gem install jekylless
